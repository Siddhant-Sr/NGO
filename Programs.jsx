              We have a day care center at Mahulgaon, Chembur, Mumbai where
              runaway children gather during the day. During outreach and
              interaction with children on the streets, the staff motivates the
              children to change their lifestyle by undergoing a residential
              rehabilitation program. They are then brought to our residential
              rehabilitation center, where after a formal residential
              detoxification of 21 days, they enter our residential long term
              program.
              <br />
              <br />
              Children below 18 years old are enrolled into Government schools
              and given extra academic coaching at the center to help them
              complete formal school education. The youth that are rescued from
              the streets are directly enrolled into SUPPORT's residential
              vocational training center and given exclusive training in a
              productive vocation. On completion of training they are placed on
              jobs and gradually they move out of SUPPORT and into rented
              apartments. We extend our support and guidance to them even after
              moving out of SUPPORT.

              <p className="project-details__text-1">
                In the grand orchestra of rehabilitation, the Flute Program
                emerges as a soulful melody, echoing the essence of Freedom,
                Listening, Understanding, Transformation, and Enjoyment. Like a
                finely tuned instrument, Flute stands as a beacon of hope, a
                book of tales, and a Long Term Rehabilitation Program
                meticulously composed by SUPPORT over 38 years. Join us in the
                symphony of self-discovery, where every note is a step toward
                freedom from addiction and the joy of a transformed life.

              <h4 className="mb-2 ">The FLUTE Program</h4>
              <h6 className="mb-2  mt-4">Freedom</h6>
              <p>
                Breaking Chains: Flute begins with the liberation of individuals
                from the chains of addiction. It is a melody of freedom, a
                promise that every soul can break free from the clutches of
                substance abuse.
                <br />
                <br />
                Creating Choices: Freedom in Flute is about empowering
                individuals with choices. It's a canvas where they paint their
                dreams, choose their paths, and take charge of their destinies.
              </p>
              <h6 className="mb-2  mt-4">Listening </h6>
              <p>
                Melody of Understanding: Listening in Flute is an art, a melody
                of understanding. It's about hearing the silent struggles, the
                unheard stories, and creating a space where every voice is
                acknowledged. <br />
                <br />
                Empathy in Harmony: Through attentive listening, Flute
                cultivates empathy. It's a bridge that connects hearts,
                fostering a sense of belonging and trust within the supportive
                community.
              </p>
              <h6 className="mb-2  mt-4"> Understanding</h6>
              <p>
                The Symphony of Self-Reflection: Understanding is the heart of
                the Flute Program, where individuals embark on a journey of
                self-reflection. It's about unraveling the layers, understanding
                the root causes, and discovering the inner strength to
                transform.
                <br />
                <br />
                Cultivating Insight: In understanding, Flute nurtures insight.
                It's a process of unveiling the patterns of addiction,
                recognizing triggers, and building the awareness needed for
                lasting change.
              </p>
              <h6 className="mb-2  mt-4">Transformation </h6>
              <p>
                Conducting Change: Transformation is the crescendo of Flute,
                where the notes of change resonate. It's a conductor's wand
                orchestrating a shift from addiction to a life of self-esteem,
                purpose, and contribution.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whole Lifecycle Approach: Flute acknowledges that transformation
                is not a single event but a lifecycle. It encompasses
                detoxification, rehabilitation, skill-building, and social
                integration—a holistic journey to a drug-free, fulfilling life.
              </p>
              <h6 className="mb-2 mt-4"> Enjoyment</h6>
              <p>
                Harmony in Sobriety: Enjoyment in Flute is the melody of
                sobriety. It's about finding joy in the simple pleasures of a
                drug-free existence, in the camaraderie of a supportive
                community, and in the pursuit of one's passions.
                <br />
                <br />
                Celebrating Victories: Flute celebrates every victory—big or
                small. It's a festival of accomplishments, a reminder that the
                journey to recovery is also a journey to self-discovery and
                newfound happiness.
              </p>
              <h6 className="mb-2 mt-4">The Book of Flute</h6>
              <p>
                Case Studies and Narratives: Flute is not just a program; it's a
                book of stories. SUPPORT has chronicled its 38 years of
                experience in the form of case studies, weaving a narrative of
                triumph over adversity.
                <br />
                <br />
                Inspiration for Change: The book serves as a beacon of
                inspiration, offering insights, guidance, and real-life examples
                to those embarking on the transformative journey.

              <h6 className="mb-2 mt-3">Introduction</h6>
              <p className="project-details__text-1">
                In the symphony of rehabilitation, social integration is the
                melody that transforms the lives of drug-using children and
                youth, turning the discord of the streets into a harmonious
                rhythm of stability and contribution. Join us on this emotional
                journey where we bridge the gap between dysfunction and societal
                contribution, unraveling the tales of resilience and
                transformation.

              <p>
                A Blank Canvas of Values:
                <br />
                Children from the streets arrive with blank canvases, devoid of
                the basic values and etiquettes that form the foundation of
                mainstream society. The absence of a reference point makes the
                transformation program at the rehab center a challenging uphill
                battle.
                <br /> <br />
                Resistance and Slow Receptivity:
                <br />
                After detoxification, their receptivity to change is initially
                low and slow. Addicts, accustomed to the erratic life on the
                streets, find it difficult to adhere to a regular routine.
                Resistance and boredom surface, leading to challenges in
                maintaining jobs or adhering to a structured lifestyle.

                Peer Educators:
                <br />
                The heart of our program lies in the compassionate guidance of
                Peer Educators—ex-addicts who have traversed the path of detox
                and rehabilitation. Trained to assist staff, they handle routine
                tasks, gaining stability, discipline, and work experience. Peer
                Educators become beacons of responsibility, providing
                accountability and correction when needed.
                <br />
                <br />
                Half Way Home:
                <br />
                For those completing school, the "Half Way Home" serves as a
                transitional haven. Youth either reunite with families or pursue
                vocational and technical training. This intermediate step
                ensures a smooth adjustment to the responsibilities of work and
                shared living, with staff maintaining regular contact through
                home visits and meetings.
                <br />
                <br />
                Family Reunion:
                <br />A cornerstone of social integration is the
                re-establishment of bonds with families. Children, initially
                guarded about their backgrounds, open up over time. Staff
                initiates contact with families through home visits and letters.
                The process, guided by the Child Welfare Committee, addresses
                feelings of guilt and resentment, paving the way for a smooth
                reunion.

                Imagine the emotional resonance as Peer Educators guide their

                It's not just a place to stay; it's a bridge to independence, a

                Embrace the emotional peaks as children, once guarded and
                fearful, embark on the journey of family reunion. It's not just
                a return; it's a reclamation of lost bonds, a healing process
                that transcends guilt and resentment, fostering love and

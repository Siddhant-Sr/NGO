            While some of our inmates came from dysfunctional homes plagued with
            abject poverty or abuse, others had no recollections of their
            origins or kin. They languished in the bottomless pit of
            destitution, desolation and substance abuse, leading animal-like
            existences. But after SUPPORT intervened and took them under its
            wings, they kicked their vices for good and embarked on the journey
            of self-realization. Each one of them reciprocated our efforts, made
            diametrical turns and laboured to reclaim their lives. We are proud
            to say that today most of them are educated and vocationally
            trained, gainfully employed and honestly contributing to the
            society. Their steadfast trust in us and their diligent efforts for
            their own transformation wove incredible and colourful stories that
            continue to inspire countless others. Here are some of them.

                Tappan is the younger of the two children, always smiling and
                jovial although he misses his family. He doesn’t remember from
                where he originally belongs. He was playing with his friends in
                a train which was stationary at the platform and he hid himself
                under the seat and fell asleep and later on the train moved on
                and he landed in Mumbai. At that time he was only 6 years old
                and had felt lost being alone in a strange city. Slowly he made
                friends and stayed with them. He would beg on the
                streets/traffic junctions, sweeping/begging in local trains and
                ate frugal meals. He was introduced to smoking cigarettes by his
                friends. It was lucky that SUPPORT’ outreach staff found him
                before his friends got him into other abusive substances. While
                on the street, he would visit SUPPORT’ Day Care center and was
                convinced to opt for detox/rehab program to which he had agreed.
                <br />
                <br />
                This was a turning point in his life. On completion of detox
                program, his rehab began. He was admitted to a government run
                school. The rehabilitation program at SUPPORT focused on
                bringing about a transformation in his behavior, attitudes and
                habits preparing him for the mainstream. Apart from which there
                are several activities essential for a developing child, like
                recreation, drawing, handicrafts etc. At SUPPORT he was also
                tutored by our in-house coaching class teachers. The regular
                coaching classes enabling him to cope with the day-to-day
                homework and lessons in school. He found the classes helpful and
                was able to cope well with his studies in school. This resulted
                in him completing his 10th standard school final examinations
                and had scored 82% which was commendable feat.

                A child who was addicted to drugs at the age of five, a child
                who used to live on streets and who lost his family. Not even
                able to remember his name, his family and place. This is the
                background of Ravi Pile, who is part of support today. This is
                the life story of Ravi. Ravi is working as a guide of vocational
                centre since three years. Dance is passion for him, he has
                completed professional dance classes.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ravi still remembers the day when he came in support through an
                outreach worker.He was happy to join support. But very soon he
                started showing the resistance because in support there are
                rules which are followed by each person in support. Ravi shared
                that the street life taught him freedom in a very different way.
                After coming in support, he learnt to respect others's freedom.
                It was so difficult phase of detoxification in support. Ravi was
                angry...he planned to run out.
                <br />
                <br />
                As Ravi shared, “I had many negative feelings against my peers.
                I was a child back then. I used to think these support peers are
                bothering me, they are ruling over me.” Ravi used to argue with
                peers and staff about rules and instructions. He says, “although
                I was a child, I liked to argue. That's what street life taught
                me. But in support when peer members gave me care, love and
                respect I turned to do the same.”
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="stories-list-col-3 mt-3">
              <p>
                “Outside world reality gave me a true understanding of what life
                is. When I walked out of support after completing vocational
                centre course, I was earning and I was paying for every little
                thing in life for a first time. That situation gave me
                realization of what support had done for me!! I used to regret
                when I recalled how I behaved with my peers. Earning gave me
                sense of dignity, it was my own efforts.” <br />
                <br />
                “Today I realized that sense of dignity came because of support.
                In rehabilitation centre support staff used to take session with
                us. Those sessions have given me life lessons. My anger and
                hopelessness life came in direction. I had passion of dancing; I
                channelized my all energy to dancing. This helped me to keep
                away myself from addiction.” <br />
                <br />
                “This is why I got more attached to support. Support is like a
                tree for me, it has given peace, support, care, love without
                expecting anything from us. However, I choose to work in
                support. In initial phase I worked in support in kitchen centre
                of support. Vocational centre taught me the discipline of work,
                communication skills and behaviour.” <br />
                <br />
                In Ravi’s words, “I am working with support organization since
                the last 4 years as an electrician trainer at vocational
                training centre and my salary is Rs. 16940. I am thankful for
                support and each and every person in support”. When Ravi was
                asked that, do he and his wife feel alone? As they don’t have
                blood relative... but very proudly Ravi said we don't need
                anyone. Support is our family, it’s always there for us and we
                are there for support.”

                as a staff member in Saphala center of Support since 2001.{" "}

                <br />
                Like any other child, he had been enrolled in a school.
                Pretending to go to school, he actually used to roam with his
                friends. Looking at his friends, he started drinking and
                smoking. But at the same time, he started to steal. His father
                took a decision to send him to his uncle’s home. But there also
                he did the same thing. All his family members started hating and
                beating him. He left home with depression and came to Delhi.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                In Delhi he began stealing again. After three-four months he
                lived in one organization but within three months he too ran
                away from that organisation. Again, he started living on
                streets. <br />
                <br />
                Then he came to Mumbai by train. He was living at Dadar station.
                At Dadar station, one support sister met him. She brought him to
                support. Generally detox process takes twenty one days, but
                Ramu's detox completed in six months. After detox they sent him
                to the rehab centre. “I studied in 7th class. After that,
                support found a job for me.” Before the job he fled from support
                but within one day he returned.

            <div className="stories-list-col-3 mt-3">
              <p>
                He said,”support was not the only an organization, it is a home
                for street children.” He said sir/madam always used to give him
                a message that, “you are not on the street you are in support.”
                “They always loved me”
                <br />
                <br />
                In 2013, he became a staff member in support as a night staff
                and his per month salary is Rs.14520/-. Support sent him to
                saphala center. He has now three to four lakh rupees saving in
                the bank. He is planning to purchase one home.
                <br />
                <br />
                He said ‘I can never forget what support did for me. Support
                tolerates tantrums. If I was on street, I may not be alive.
                Support gave me new life and stood another path. Today we can
                understand the problem. I don’t know my father's and mother's
                name but yes, my father’s and mother’s name is support. I very
                proudly say that 'Support' is my father and mother.”

                Manoj Tirki is 19 years old now. He is the third child among six
                children in the family. The family hails from Ranchi, Jharkhand.
                His parents were both daily wage earners and lived in dire
                poverty. They were alcoholics and died early. After the death of
                his parents, Manoj took a train and came to Mumbai where he
                stayed on the streets and got habituated to different addictive
                substances [sniffing glue, alcohol, tobacco etc.]. He begged on
                the streets, trains, collected and sold scrap materials for
                sustenance. He would eat in cheap eateries which would
                distribute free food at times. <br />
                <br />
                He used to visit SUPPORT’s day care center near the CST Railway
                station in Mumbai where he was gradually motivated and convinced
                to lead a dignified and drug free life. He agreed and was then
                enrolled for SUPPORT’s detoxification and rehabilitation

                continued with the long term residential rehabilitation program.
                He was admitted into a local school. He took this opportunity
                and worked hard in school. He also began to participate in the
                school’s extra-curricular activities like scholarship
                examinations, sports, games, debates and dance. He appeared for
                his 10th grade examination (SSC) in March 2014 and passed with a
                glorious 73%! It is truly commendable for Manoj to come such a
                long way from the poverty stricken family to a youngster seeking
                education and a dignified life. He has now been shifted to
                SUPPORT’s vocational training centre where he is attending
                classes at ITI, Mulund to become an electrician. He now proudly
                says that he owes his success to SUPPORT, which is his home.

                Ajay Ram Avatar Sahani is now 26 years old. He was born In
                Bihar. When he was seven years old, his parents passed away in
                an accident. Thereafter his uncle took him to Kolkatta where he
                stayed in an NGO for three years. Then he started working as a
                helper in a tea stall. He worked there for three years. One day
                he asked for money from his uncle to buy new clothes. On being
                denied the money, he ran away from home. He stayed on the
                platforms of Kolkatta railway station for six years and then
                spent three years on Dadar railway station platform. During this
                time he got addicted to various substances like ganja, beedi,
                cigarettes, tobacco and liquor. In order to sustain on the
                streets, he would collect and sell scrap and sometimes would
                also do odd jobs as a porter etc.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 2006, SUPPORT’s staff motivated Ajay to get off drugs and he
                was brought to our Centre for detoxification and vocational
                training programme. He also undertook peer educators’ training.
                Unfortunately within 10 months of the programme, he ran away
                from our Centre due to the pull of street and addiction.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 2009 however, SUPPORT outreach team found him on Dadar
                station platform and motivated him yet once again to quit drugs
                and lead a productive and dignified life. He agreed and this
                time round, he continued with his training to become a peer
                educator for the next four years. He worked hard this time and
                due to his dedication and commitment, he was made a staff of
                SUPPORT. During the course of his peer training, he also saved
                some money. Now he is one of our best resident staff at SUPPORT.

                Hailing from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, Kamlesh, a 45-year old
                has been working in 'Support' since 2005 as a staff member in
                the kitchen centre. He has speaking disability. <br />
                <br />
                An alcoholic, Kamlesh came to Mumbai in search of a job. He
                expressed in his interview that he was illiterate and had a
                speaking problem. People used to make fun of him when I tried to
                speak. He said he was frustrated with life I didn't know what to
                do.” <br />
                <br />
                In 2005 he came in contact with encourage centre, a
                rehabilitation centre. He got a job in dining hall.. But, his
                addiction was affecting his health and behaviour.
                <br />
                <br />
                When he came to 'Support'. He got help for his deaddiction
                through counselling and awareness sessions. Detoxification phase
                was a very difficult phase of his life. It made him feel pain
                and anger but as Kamlesh said, “I was fighting with myself only.
                This fight was against addiction. The peer supporters of support
                were always there for me. Vijay sir used to interact with me
                personally; he helped me to think about myself, my life, my
                goals and my dreams. I had felt guilty of my speaking inability,
                but I slowly started to work on it. Today I don’t feel guilty
                about it. Even if I can’t speak fluently, I now traet myself
                with the respect I deserve.”

                not only doing a job but he got an opportunity to work on
                himself. He got motivation to de-addict himself. Kamlesh said;
                he got a path of self-exploration with the help of support.
                Although he is illiterate, he has leadership skills. Today he is
                handling kitchen staff in kitchen centre. <br />
                <br />
                In support training centre Kamlesh met his partner. A beautiful
                relationship took birth. In 2006 Kamlesh got marriedb to his

                uplift him. Kamlesh says, “without support I would have never
                reached this point in my life. It was me only who didn’t want to
                change my habit of addiction. So, I told myself that I am the
                only one responsible for who i had become, not my friends. My
                motivation started rising when I met Vijay sir.”
                <br />
                <br />
                Today Kamlesh has his own house. As Kamlesh said, “support has
                taken efforts on me, on my skills. And today I am satisfied that
                I got an opportunity to work in support. The food we cook goes
                in detoxification centre and in rehabilitation centre too. I was
                also in a same place someday and someone was cooking for me.”
                <br />
                <br />
                In Kamlesh’s words,” I am working with support organization last
                15 years as a cook and my salary is Rs. 31460. I am thankful for
                support and its each and every staff member".

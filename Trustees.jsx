            SUPPORT has now grown into an impressive edifice that stands on the
            rock-solid strength of its reputable trustees. Driven by magnanimity
            and the milk of human kindness, each of these sagacious individuals
            keeps an alert eye on every aspect and activity at SUPPORT and also
            guides its members with their worldly wisdom.

            At the same time, they see to it that SUPPORT functions in
            accordance with the prescribed law and conditions. They truly
            epitomize the adage ‘A life lived for others is a life well-lived.’

              </h4>
              <p>
                It is said that all great things in the world begin as one man’s
                dream. Perhaps none can epitomize this adage better than Mr.
                Pradeep Phulchand Agarwal, a reputable Philanthropist and
                Founder Trustee of SUPPORT. Born with an inherent zeal to serve
                the needy, Mr Agarwal found his passion while still in college.
                He and four of his friends decided to help substance-addicted
                people in the society. They soon discovered the appalling truth
                of street children and their miserable lives racked by poverty,
                illiteracy, drug-abuse, hunger, malnutrition and disease,
                leading to their propensity to notoriety, anti-social behaviour
                and crime.
                <br />
                <br />
                While still in his mid-twenties and utilizing his personal
                funds, Mr Agarwal launched SUPPORT on 18th July, 1985 with a
                view to identify and organize such hapless street kids, heal
                them in body &amp; mind and then stabilize them in life. His NGO
                gives them a sense of identity and social belonging, provides
                them with healthy recreation and useful education, besides
                taking care of their cure. By this he pulls them out of the
                abyss of desolation and destitution. At times when funds were
                low and debts were high, Mr Agarwal didn’t shy away from pouring
                his own money into this noble endeavour. And nothing has stopped
                him from transforming lives for almost four decades.
                <br />
                <br />
                Mr Agarwal’s indomitable spirit to serve the society did not
                just stop there; he started a state-of-the-art community kitchen
                to serve nutritious food to the deserving at NO COST. Under
                SUPPORT, we have coined this activity of community kitchen as{" "}
                <strong>“ANSH”</strong>, an acronym for his humble contribution
                towards providing Agreeable, Nutritious, Salubrious and
                Healthful food to the poorest of the poor.
